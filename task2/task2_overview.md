# Task 2 - The Brain
An electronic speed controller (ESC), which regulates a motor's speed, can be managed by the ATmega328P. In this application, the remote control, such as a joystick, sends commands to a receiver, which the microcontroller reads as signals. The ESC then modifies the power supplied to the motor, altering its speed, in response to signals sent by the microcontroller. Other ESC settings, like acceleration, braking, and the type of motor being controlled, can also be made using the ATmega328P. You can fine-tune the performance of the motor for a particular application, such as a drone, electric bicycle, or robot, by programming the ATmega328P.
