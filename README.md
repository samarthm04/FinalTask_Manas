WORKING OF AN ADJUSTABLE VOLTAGE REGULATOR

•	A variable voltage regulator is highly versatile as it is capable of providing variable voltage.-A popular adjustable voltage regulator- the LM317 is capable of outputting a voltage between the ranges 1.2V and 37V, therefore it is highly versatile and has multiple use cases

•	The voltage is set with the help of 2 external resisters, one is a fixed resistor and the second one is a variale resistor
•	The LM317 consists of 3 pins:

1-ADJ-pin through which voltage is adjusted.
2-Vin- voltage input pin.
3-Vout-Voltage output pin.

In this way, Vout can be varied with change in R2 ie the variable resistor.
