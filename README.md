# Electronic Speed Controllers



An electronic speed controller (ESC) is an electronic circuit used to control the speed of an electric motor. It is commonly used in radio-controlled (RC) vehiclessuch as aeroplanes, helicopters, cars, and boats. Still, we can also use it in other applications that require precise control over the speed of a motor.



The ESC receives a signal from the receiver in the RC vehicle, which tells it how fast the motor should spin. The ESC then adjusts the power delivered to the motor, which controls its speed. This is done by adjusting the timing and frequency of the electric signals sent to the motor.
